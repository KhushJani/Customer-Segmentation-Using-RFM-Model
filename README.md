# Customer-Segmentation-Using-RFM-Model
Segmentation of customers in online retail databases using Python, including RFM analysis and clustering.

Customer Segmentation is the subdivision of a market into discrete customer groups that share similar characteristics. Customer Segmentation can be a powerful means to identify unsatisfied customer needs. Using the above data companies can then outperform the competition by developing uniquely appealing products and services.
Advantages of Customer Segmentation 

1.	Determine appropriate product pricing.
2.	Develop customized marketing campaigns.
3.	Design an optimal distribution strategy.
4.	Choose specific product features for deployment.
5.	Prioritize new product development efforts.

K Means Clustering Algorithm
1.	Specify number of clusters K.
2.	Initialize centroids by first shuffling the dataset and then randomly selecting K data points for the centroids without replacement.
3.	Keep iterating until there is no change to the centroids. i.e assignment of data points to clusters isnâ€™t changing.

The Challenge

You are owing a supermarket mall and through membership cards, you have some basic data about your customers like Customer ID, age, gender, annual income and spending score. You want to understand the customers like who are the target customers so that the sense can be given to marketing team and plan the strategy accordingly.

Environment and tools
1.	scikit-learn
2.	seaborn
3.	numpy
4.	pandas
5.	matplotlib
